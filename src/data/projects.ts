    shortDesc: "A Turkish warrior's battle against zombies.",
    desc:"This was a school project I built with a friend. The video still shows a few bugs we later fixed, but we didn’t re-record a new demo. It was also my first time using GitHub. Making a game was a blast—we used Unity, and all the assets are my own drawings. Along the way I learned a lot about physics, animation state transitions, bullet mechanics, enemy spawning, and testing/balancing.",

    title: "Bus Automation System", 
    shortDesc: "A system to automate bus operations and improve public transport efficiency.",
    desc:`This was my university graduation project. The system includes both an admin panel and a user panel. In the admin panel, you can find an authorization system, indicators, statistics and charts, ticket sales, creating trips, map and terminal management, settings, and support. Each user can be given permissions from super admin to regular staff, and the admin panel adapts based on these permissions.
    On the user side, people can register or proceed as guests to buy tickets, track buses, get help and support, cancel tickets, and more. I used many features of C#, from object-oriented programming to inheritance. I spent a lot of time making the map functional and giving the interface a modern look.`,

    title: "Event Tracking System", 
    shortDesc: "A system to track and manage events efficiently.",
    desc:`This is a simple and minimalist event tracking system I built for university. Normally, when an event was planned, teachers would just send out a form to count participants, and if it got canceled, not everyone would be informed. To solve this, I created a system with separate logins for students, teachers, and admins.
    Students can view upcoming events, decide whether they’ll attend, and get notified if the event is postponed or canceled. Teachers can create events, see which students are attending, and export the list to Excel. Admins can add new teachers to the system and check logs.`,

    desc:`This is a project I built to practice what I learned during my internship. It’s actually my personal website and portfolio — the very site you’re reading this on right now. I added lots of different components and tried to structure it in a way that feels close to real-world projects. Inside, you’ll find my skills, projects, and some info about me.
    I’m still planning to add more, like a mini game or a virtual pet, a blog section, and a more detailed page about my hobbies.`,
